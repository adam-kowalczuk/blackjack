# Blackjack

Blackjack is the most popular casino game in the world, but that doesn't mean we can't play a few hands in the terminal.

Some things to note:

- A score of '0' means 'Blackjack' (a hand of two cards that equals 21)
- There is no option to split

This project was created for Dr. Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
