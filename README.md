# Black Jack

Blackjack is the most popular casino game in the world, but that doesn't mean we can't play a few hands in the terminal? Can you hit 21 without going over?.

This project was created for Dr. Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
